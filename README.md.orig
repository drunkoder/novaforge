## Description

Nova Forge aims to develop a comprehensive buy and sell platform to facilitate the trade of mining resources within the space mining industry. This platform will include an Admin Console for managing resources and settings, a Stellar Marketplace for users to explore mining areas, make purchases, and sell items.
This project consists of a back-end server and two front-end applications: one for the marketplace and another for admin management. It provides functionalities for users and administrators to interact with the system.
